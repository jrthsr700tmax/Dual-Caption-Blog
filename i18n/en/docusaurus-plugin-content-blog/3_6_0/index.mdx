# YouTube™ Dual Caption 3.6.0 Update Notes

### Fix statement merging 🎉

 In the previous version, statement merging was not done in order to follow YouTube's own behavior.

This caused the sentences to be choppy when playing the video, and downloading subtitles also caused the timeline to be cluttered.

In version 3.6.0, this problem has been fixed and more details have been optimized.

Removed extra spaces in merge statements.

```

### Dual subtitles give priority to video subtitles

 In the past, bilingual subtitles were always machine-translated. Now, the existing subtitles of the video will be used first, and machine translation will be used if there is no subtitle.

 If the bilingual video already has subtitles, an optimization indicator will be displayed.

 Downloading subtitles will also have the same optimization, with a tick in the middle of the filename.

<Tip>The logo indicates that the current bilingual subtitles use the existing subtitles of the video, not machine translation.</Tip>

### Turn off custom styles

 This version provides the option to turn off the custom style, and can set the subtitle order and spacing independently.

<Tip>Tip: The premise of this optimization is that the two subtitles must match exactly.</Tip>

### Download subtitles in the same order as they are displayed
